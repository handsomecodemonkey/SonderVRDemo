Welcome to the Sonder VR Demo!
Today we're going to learn about Body Language.
It's important to understand what a person's body language is saying,
but sometimes it can be hard to understand.
I'm giving you some magic binoculars.
They let you see what a person's body language is saying.
Try it out by looking at me!

Today we're going to look at some stories. 
After the story, you'll be asked a few questions. 
Don't worry if you can't answer them, just try your best! 
After the questions, you can re-experience the story from the perspective of the characters.
