Welcome to the Sonder VR Demo!
Today we're going to learn about Body Language.
It's important to understand what a person's body language is saying,
but sometimes it can be hard to understand.
I'm giving you some magic binoculars.
Try them out by looking at me and pressing X.
They let you see what a person's body language is saying.
You can hide this display by pressing X again. 
Today we're going to look at some stories. 
After the story, you'll be asked a few questions. 
Don't worry if you can't answer them, just try your best! 
After the questions, you can re-experience the story from the perspective of the characters.
